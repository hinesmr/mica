Meta Language learning (MLL) is a data-driven, reading and
instant messaging experience which uses memory-assistance and
analytics to that track what words you know and don't know
as you read through stories that you provide. You create the
content and we provide sophisticated, interactive assistance 
to help you navigate through your stories as you learn a new language.


Currently it supports, English/Spanish, English/Chinese,
Chinese/English, Spanish/English, but the basic infrastructure 
is already in place for more languages in the future.


<h3 id='motivation'>Motivation: (All languages)</h3>


Think back to when you were in grade school learning your native language. The teacher
would assign you stories or novels to read to teach you the grammar and structure
of the language. When you reached a new word that you didn't understand, did you whip
out your smartphone? No, probably not. You made a "guess" about the word in context
by looking at the words to the left and to the right. If that didn't work, you talked
to a human (probably your parents, sibling or teacher). Only then if that didn't work
would you go find a dictionary.


That's precisely how MLL is designed to work: You learn by reading, but instead the software
tracks your vocabulary FOR you. Occasionally you use that same corpus of vocabulary to
go and chat with real people in our same user interface, but the real magic of the system
is to emulate the same experience you did when you were younger through reading while
allowing YOU to import the content at your reading level that you care about and not
depend on someone else to choose that content for you.


<h3 id='motivationchinese'>Motivation: (Character-based)</h3>


The basic observation behind creating this learning
system is very simple: The most well-spoken foreigners
in the we know all have a particular trait in common
that really stands out: 


<img width='10%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reader.jpg"/>


They are all voracious readers - sometimes they even have 
better test scores than native speakers. It's spooky how well 
avid reading correlates to fluent speaking.


We first start with Character-based languages (like Chinese)
in this introduction, and then later
show how the software also applies equally to Romanized languages
like English as well. All languages benefit from 
of our approach to learning by reading.


<h3>Meet the Enemy:</h3>




<div style='font-size: 800%'>汉字</div>




These are the 'characters' that represent Chinese Characters.



<h3 id='problem'>The phonetic problem:</h3>


<h4>汉字 (Hàn zì) != Phonetic Sounds</h4>


Now, to be fair, billions of people use character systems.
In fact, if you ask a native speaker what their frustration
was when they first learned English, they will tell you the
complete opposite of the phonetic problem: Which is that
romanized words don't have pictures associated with them!


<img width='10%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/frustration.jpg"/>



But they are taking for granted that the romanization bootstraps
their language learning by giving them (nearly) immediate
access to the ability to pronounce what they see. =)


Ok, so, why is this a problem at all? Speakers of character-based
languages don't seem to think it's a problem, right? 
Well, it's a problem of frequency:


What would a foreigner in China, for example, do on a daily basis?


1. Reading philosophy texts?                          No.
2. Studying for your law degree?                      Ummmm. No.
3. Driving around the city reading street signs?      (Maybe). 
4. Having casual dinners with VIPs and business men?  Yeah, right.
5. Arguing with the wife about what's for dinner?     Yes! Yes!


<img width='10%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/teacher.jpg"/>



So, in my daily language learning classes, I told
the teacher, "I don't want to battle with the phonetic problem",
and immediately her reaction was, "What? You want to be illiterate?"


Well, of course not. Actually, I want to be VERY literate,
because as I foreshadowed above, the best foreign speakers
are the ones the read the most literature (and the ones that 
watch the most TV shows, too =).



<img width='10%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/bridgingthegap.jpg"/>



So, we need a tool - something to bridge the gap
between the ability to vocalize language and the ability to read
the vocalizations. Something that would immediately
give us the same mental stimulus for Character-based languages
that a well-spoken foreign English speaker would experience.


<h4>Enter: MLL.</h4>



<img width='10%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/smile.jpg"/>



<h3 id='usage'>Software Instructions:</h3>


Getting Started:


First, begin by copy and pasting a story using the 'Upload New Story'
button in the "Account" menu at the top:


You have two choices:


1. Upload a text file in native Characters (like a short story 
or even an e-book) in UTF-8 encoded format.
2. Copy and paste a news article or email in native characters.



<img width='20%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/upload.png"/>



As you can see in the above example, I have copy and pasted
the following characters, and selected "Chinese to English". If you
are learning English instead, you could similarly choose "English to Spanish":



<h2>花园里有三只蝴蝶，一只是红色的，一只是黄色的，一只是白色的。</h2>



Here is a similar example if you are learning English:


<img width='20%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/engupload.png"/>



Since we assume the user is starting from scratch, MLL has never seen
these characters before and will create a new story in your database
containing your new story.


Click on the <b>Top Left</b> corner of the page to expand the navigation
section:


<img width='20%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/uploaded.png"/>



There are 4 sections in the left-hand pane:


<ol>
<li class='anch'><b>"Not Ready"</b>: These are stories that you just uploaded but
which have not yet been prepared yet.</li>
<li class='anch'><b>"Not reviewed"</b>: These are prepared stories which have not
been reviewed first by a native speaker to correct for invalid conjugations or polyphomes,
in the case of character-based languages, which we will explain later.</li>
<li class='anch'><b>"Reading"</b>: These are post-reviewed stories which have passed up
through the lower two sections and ready for regular language learning
and review.</li>
<li class='anch'><b>"Finished"</b>: Stories go here when you're finished with them.</li>
</ol>


You can begin by first clicking 'Translate' and waiting for your first translation.



<img width='10%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/translating.png"/>



Once the translation has completed, the story will appear in the "Not reviewed" section.
Some large stories, particularly ones that are very dense or have many pages,
can take a very long time to translate as MLL is doing a lot of work to properly group
together characters into words and prepare the story for you. Periodically
MLL has to go online to get a translation, or even reverse-engineer
Pinyin-to-character pronunciations, so be patient. (There's a lot going on behind the scenes).



<img width='10%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/translated.png"/>



After you refresh the page, the story will move into the 'Not Reviewed'
section like, this and will have a number of icons next to the story
to indicate the next steps you have to take in the story:



<img width='10%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/notreviewed.png"/>



First, you should go to 'Account' and then click on 'Review' to switch the current story to Review mode.



<h3 id='review'>Reviewing before Learning (Review Mode)</h3>


Now, we get to the good stuff first: Review mode is the first of the
three modes and designed to give the language learner and opportunity 
to read a "Sanitized" translated story.


This mode is used to build "clean" material for the learner to read. We
want to be able to process large amounts of meanings (and pinyin if this
is a character-based language) for the learner from MLL as fast as 
possible as if the learner were reading a book of literature with the 
same experience as an English novel. To do that, we first need to review
the text first for any errors in meaning or tone.


<h4 id='reviewcharacter'>Character-based Reviewing:</h4>


With Character-based languages, not all words have a single meaning, and in
particular with Chinese, not all characters have the same tone,
and even words that have the same tone don't have the same meaning!


In "Review" mode, a new learner will want to get a "buddy" who is a native
speaker to "review" their newly uploaded story in this mode:



<img width='20%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/viewmode.png"/>


The way review mode works is that non-blue words may or may not have more
than one definition, sound, or tone. In a Character-based language, these kinds of words are
also are called <b>"Polyphomes"</b>. These are words that have been identified 
as not having a single meaning and/or sound per word and are fuzzy or 
have the same sound but multiple definitions (for Chinese only).


As you can see from the "Legend" on the side, MLL classifies
and analyzes words in different ways:


<div style='font-weight: bold; color: grey; display: inline'>Grey words</div> only have a single sound and single meaning, and by
clicking on them you will see their translations of the word 
after the story was processed. For the reviewer, it is not necessary to
spend to much time on these words as they are NOT Polyphomes
and their translations already accurate. (If they are not correct, then
the database used by MLL can sometimes be wrong as well - it is not impossible).


<div style='font-weight: bold; color: green; display: inline'>Green words</div> only have a single sound but have different
meanings. For Character-based languages, technically, they are not polyphomes, but they 
are treated as fuzzy, because they have different meanings. The language learner will
not inadvertently learn the wrong sound (safe), but may inadvertently learn
the wrong meaning. However, even if the wrong meaning is memorized without
a proper review by a native speaker, the incorrect meaning will immediately
become obvious in context as the meaning will likely not make much sense.


<div style='font-weight: bold; color: red; display: inline'>Red words</div> may several different sounds
as well sounds. These words need special attention by the reviewer 
so that the language learner does memorize the wrong meaning or tone. 
Eventually, more advanced learners can perform these reviews by oneself
because they will be able to select the correct choice by reading in context.


<div style='font-weight: bold; color: black; display: inline'>Black words</div> are words that have a "history" of being wrong
because they were previously reviewed and corrected in the past across
the entire story database. MLL performs sophisticated analytics to 
automatically recognize these words upon new translations and assigns 
percentages to figure out which polyphomes have the highest chance of 
being correct. The new story does not have any black words yet because 
we have not performed any corrections - to come later.


In the below example, we have clicked on the the words and pinyin 
for 'one': "yī" (一). This first results in exposing a small blue 'play
button. By clicking this button, the learner is challenged to first remember
what the meaning is before revealing it. This results in expanding all occurrences
of the character and its translation, resulting in showing the translation 
for that word.



<img width='20%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/definition1.png"/>



Red, green, and black words, however need to be reviewed for accuracy, 
by clicking on the word, the different possibilities for that character 
will appear. Let's first start with a "green" word:



<img width='20%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple1.png"/>


In the above example, we have clicked on the sound 'lǐ' (里), which
usually means 'inside' of something. As you can see in the pop-up,
the 'Default' selected polyphome is incorrect - it translates to
500 meters (or half a kilometer. Half of a unit of measure is very
common in Chinese). Also noticed that because it's green, all the
sounds are exactly the same, but only differ in their English meaning.


Checking this is very important distinction in MLL, because later in
'Read' mode, MLL will keep track of exactly which words the learner
has memorized and which words the learner has not memorized. So,
if you don't correct the polyphomes, MLL will think you have memorized
the wrong word, when in fact you have not.


So, by choosing the 'Select' button, we can correct MLL so that
the correct word is 'inside':



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple.png"/>



Also pay attention to the "Percentages" on the left-hand side
of the correct choice: This indicates that MLL
has recorded how 'popular' this selection is and will re-use this
information the next time a story is translated, so that the
reviewer does not need to select it again in the future.


Upon refreshing the page, this character is now listed as
'black', indicating that it now has a history in MLL:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple2.png"/>


It also includes a "(1)" next to it as well as being listed on
the right-hand side of the page indicating that this particular
word has undergone that number of changes in the history
of the database of stories for this user.


The next time a story that is translated containing this word,
MLL will modify the default choice to be the most popular one
so that the reviewer can focus their time on harder-to-identify
words.


Finally, let's take a look at "red" words, as in the word 'zhī' (只):


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple3.png"/>


This time, notice that MLL is telling us that there are multiple
completely different sounds for the same word. In this case,
there are both a 1st tone and 3rd tone listings for the same
character. This time, MLL chose the correct choice by
default, so there is no need to spend anymore time on this word. 


Unfortunately, if you haven't learned at least a little of your new
language before starting the software, you'll have to ask your best
friend, your significant other, or your co-worker who
is a native speaker to help you out on your first few stories 
until you get fluent enough at context-matching to know when a 
choice is wrong or not by yourself.


<h4 id='reviewromanized'>Romanized Reviewing:</h4>


When learning a romanized language, like English, the most difficult thing for MLL
to get right the first time around is verb conjugation and pronouns. While we do our
best to make initial guesses, we rely on you and your initial review of the content
before using the story for reading-based learning. In the future, we'll use statistics
and additional analytics to bear the load, but until then, here 
is a similar example in Review mode of an English story from before:



Let's first upload a new story to learn English as a native Spanish Speaker:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story1.png"/>


We then initialize:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story3.png"/>


And prepare:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story6.png"/>



And then click 'Review':



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story7.png"/>



And we arrive at this result:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story8.png"/>



If you look off to the right again, you'll see how MLL classifies individual words:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story9.png"/>


<div style='font-weight: bold; color: grey; display: inline'>Grey words</div> only have a single conjugation, depending on the correctness of the database MLL has at hand. 
<div style='font-weight: bold; color: green; display: inline'>Green words</div> have different definitions or conjugations. 


Let's focus on the word 'you'. It's clear that MLL has guessed wrong, 
as our Spanish database is essentially empty:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story10.png"/>


Above, we have the option to select the "correct" conjugation. The results in an indicated '(1)'
next to the word after we've chosen the correct one. Also noticed the '100%' next to our choice.
MLL will automatically analyze new stories that you import and use the selection as the default
selection in the future.


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story17.png"/>



Here's another example, while learning English instead as a native Chinese speaker:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/engreview.png"/>


The way review mode works in this case is that 
you would click on the word "Red", revealing both a noun and an adjective:



<img width='20%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/definition2.png"/>



Similarly, for English, the word "Red" is not a noun in this case,
but instead is an adjective. So by choosing the right meaning, we
have the result:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/engcorrect.png"/>


The result is that we would have:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple4.png"/>


This choice for Red will automatically be chosen (based on percentages) in future imported content.


<h3 id='readingmode'>Reading Mode</h3>


Here's where the real fun begins and the full benefit of MLL comes in to play:


Once you (or your friend) have completed an initial review of
the story, you can go back "promote" the story to the Reading section.


<h4 id='readingmodecharacter'>Character-based Reading:</h4>


Let's see an example in a character based language, such as Chinese:


<img width='20%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reviewed.png"/>



By clicking "Read" on that story, you will now see a complete view of the reviewed story:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reading1.png"/>


In this mode, you will see a slightly different structure:
All the original words and corrected meanings are black,
but their translations are not automatically expanded by default.
This is to challenge the learner to try to remember words in
context before indicating to MLL which ones you have memorized.
MLL explicitly does not translate entire sentences. That would defeat
the purpose of getting you to learn in context, even if the individual
word translations are not completely accurate.


By clicking the 'reveal' button icon at the top: 



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reveal.png"/>



We can automatically reveal all the meanings. (Or you can just click the individual
blue icons to reveal individual means, which is more common while
using the software over time.)



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reading.png"/>



What does this mean? If a word is automatically expanded upon
first loading the page, it means that you have not yet memorized the word.


Let's start by interacting with MLL: Let's click on some of
the translations to indicate that we have memorized a couple of
the most commonly early-learned words:


We have clicked on the translations of the words "yī" (一), and 'zhī' (只):



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/memorizing.png"/>


MLL will process the request and then hide the translations
from you, indicating that you have memorized those words. In both cases,
MLL will memorize and record memorizations for all occurrences of those words. 


The resulting page will look like this with the memorized words hidden:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/memorized.png"/>


These words will stay hidden by default the next time you come
back to read this story in the future.


Furthermore, if you click the 'refresh' icon after reading for a while, 
you will notice that the right-hand side of the page has more
useful tracking information:



<img width='10%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/engprogress.png"/>



This is kind of self-explanatory, but gives you some rewarding information
about exactly what percentage of the words you have memorized.


And, let's say that a week later you have forgotten a particular word, you can
simply find the word in the list, click the 'X' and the MLL
will record that the word has been forgotten (or un-memorized).


Even if you forget the word, but don't want to remove it from the
memorization list, you can just click on the 'black' pinyin readings
of the words to expose the original translation without
telling MLL to track anything additionally.


Furthermore: Just as in the 'Review' and 'Edit' modes, newly translated
stories will automatically track which words you have memorized and
which ones you have not memorized without you having to re-select
them in the future. As the database grows with more stories, there's
no need for you to make additional selections unless your memory changes.


This where the real power comes from: 
You can now spend much finer granularities of time using the 
'Reading' mode of the software as well as having conversations
(via Chat mode) with native speakers to help you navigate the stories you 
are reading while you read more and more complicated texts. 
The more you read, the more you are forced to speak in your mind, 
and the better you become!



<h4 id='readingmoderomanized'>Romanized Reading:</h4>


Let's look at an example in English as a native Spanish speaker would see it,
using the same example "Roses are Red" above that we visited in Review mode:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story12.png"/>


So far, we haven't memorized anything yet. Let's start by expanding the word 'is':


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story13.png"/>


Clicking the translation 'es' in Spanish makes it disappear, indicating that we've memorized it.


Let's expand and memorize a few more words a the end:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story14.png"/>



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story15.png"/>


Which results in the following statistics in the side panel:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/story16.png"/>



Let's again look at a similar example in English, but instead for a Chinese-native speaker:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reading3.png"/>



Let's expand all of the words at the same time:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reading2.png"/>



Let's click on the word "Violet":



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/memorizing2.png"/>


Now, it is memorized:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/memorized2.png"/>




<h3 id='editing'>Edit Mode: (Character-based only)</h3>


This mode is equally as import as 'Review' mode: Sometimes, MLL 
improperly groups the wrong words together, for example in a 
different story:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/badgroup.png"/>



This mode is not supported when learning a language like English,
because because words are single units of meaning. But in a Character-based
language, a single "word" can be composed of multiple picture-based
characters. This mode will be disabled if your story is originally
written in English.


In the above example, the characters (穿着) are incorrectly
grouped together by MLL, and since they are grouped together
they have a single, fixed meaning: 'Chuān zhuó', which translates
as "attire" a [beautiful flower dress]. This is not correct, and instead 
the characters should be separated, as in: (穿 着), which instead 
means: "Chuān zhe", which translates as "wear a" [beautiful flower dress].


Without a native speaker reviewing the story, the language learner
might clue in to the fact that 'attire' doesn't make much sense
in the story. They could confirm this fact by first clicking on
the characters themselves:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/badselected.png"/>



After clicking the characters, then you would click 'Instant' at 
the top of the page and wait for the online translation to complete:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/instantclick.png"/>



MLL will then do an instant translation online by translating
the individual characters in pieces and return an instant result:



<img width='20%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/instant.png"/>



As you can see, the individual characters for (穿着) actually
translate roughly to: "wear a" [beautiful flower dress] as 
opposed to "attire" [beautiful flower dress].


Solution: To solve this problem, you would click on the "Split"
button at the top of the page selecting only the individual characters
for "attire" as their are currently listed.



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/splitselect.png"/>



A dialog will appear confirming that you indeed want to split this
word apart into its constituent characters:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/splitconfirm.png"/>



Which then results in reloading the story with the correct elements:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/splitfinish.png"/>



A similar problem happens in MLL when an already-separated group of
characters were not correctly merged into a single word, as in the
following example:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergebad.png"/>



In the above examples, the two characters at the end of the sentence
"shí hòu" (时候) should in fact be merged into a single word
which instantly translates as "when" (an extension of the word 'time'):



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergeinstant.png"/>



This can easily be fixed in edit mode by, again selecting on the
individual words and then selecting the "Merge" icon buttom:

After confirming that you really want to merge them together:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergeconfirm.png"/>



The characters in the story will then read as:



<img width='10%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergecomplete.png"/>



(NOTE: A merge will not occur if MLL cannot find a definition
for a merged group of words - the result is that the characters will
continue to remain separated).


Finally, MLL is also smart enough to know the history of various
merged and split words. By clicking the 'forget' button on the left
hand side of the story and re-translating the story (or by translating
another story that shares some common characters with the above example),
we can see how MLL is learning our editing behavior as we use
the software:



<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/regroupsummary.png"/>



As you can see in the story and the legend, we now have the story
presented as it was originally translated without the proper edits,
but instead, MLL is showing us that the two previous words and
characters are "suggested" to be merged and split.


All of these tools together are designed to make the reading experience
as accurate as possible and as the language learner gets better and
better, they will need to rely less and less on others to correct
the story for them and more on themselves.


Notice there is a "Try Recommendations" in both Review Mode and Edit modes.
This option will "Bulk" edit or "Bulk" review any words recommended by MLL
that were found to need review or editing based on your previous usage history.


This is very useful in large books, like PDFs, where lots of content has
a similar, highly-repetitive review/edit history. MLLs analytics can automatically
recognized when these kinds of changes need to be repeated.


<h3 id='chatmode'>Chat Mode</h3>


Chat mode is one of the most exciting features to come out of the MLL system:


Chat in our environment is especially powerful, because now that we are maintaining
essentially a model of your brain's vocabulary, we can take that same model and
interactively present it back to you in real time simultaneously while you are
chatting with peers. This is nothing less than a secret weapon aimed directly at
the mundane nature of traditional ways of learning a language. Not only are you
able to import content, but that content then forms the basis of assisting your
chat experience. 


Further more, all traditional chat histories become stories within themselves,
which allow you to revisit them like prose or literature and continue learning
without any end.


<h4 id='chatmodecharacter'>Character-based Chat:</h4>


Let's look at an example of how this works for a native English speaker trying
to learn Chinese:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/charchat1.png"/>


We've developed a custom IME that looks up your message on-the-fly which not only show you
the assisted input selections but also your own language learning meta-data too. It's
perhaps one of the most amazing realizations that we had when developing the system:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/charchat2.png"/>


After making the selection and sending the message, we can continue to interact with it just like
we were using reading mode of a story:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/charchat3.png"/>


Similarly, we've just received a message from a buddy showing as a word that we've never learned before:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/charchat5.png"/>


And we can expand and learn from that word interactively without ever leaving the comfort of the chat window. 



<h4 id='chatmoderomanized'>Romanized Chat:</h4>


Let's look at a chat message session for an Spanish-native learning english:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/chat1.png"/>


The IME (input management engine) is not just for character based languages, but assists us
in realtime with meta-data from our own database without ever having to leave the comfort of
the chat window. 


In this message, we don't actually know the Spanish translation of the word 'me', so MLL shows it to us
on the fly:


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/chat3.png"/>


After sending the message, we can interact with individual words in the chat window just as we would
with any story in the database.


<h3 id='social'>Social Learning:</h3>


The future of the MLL system is really limitless.
This software could allow for users on the main website to be able to
share content with one another, share edit/review history and
publish stories they have learned back to the public.


We would eventually like to have a "marketplace", possibly with
agreements with publishers where new learners need not necessarily
perform any edits or reviews whatsoever and can benefit from a social
community that grows an ever-increasing pool of learning material
provided by the users themselves, all driven by statistics and analytics
where the days or rote-memory education are all but dead.


One user might spend hours, weeks, or months getting very good at a language.
We could then convert the analytics data tracked by MLL and apply it
to a new learner.


Simiarly, a book publishing company might be able to provide MLL-compatible
versions of an E-Book for an educational institution, giving both them
or the public another tool to achieve self-paced language study.


The power of this interactive reading format as a way to learn a language
can only grow...


<h3>Happy reading!</h3>
