MICA is a language-learning memory-assisted software program
that tracks what words you know and don't know
as you read through stories. 

Currently it supports English/Chinese and Chinese/English, 
but the basic infrastructure is
already in place for more languages in the future.

<h3 id='motivation'>Motivation:</h3>
The basic observation behind creating this learning
system is very simple: The most well-spoken foreigners
in the we know all have a particular trait in common
that really stands out: 

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reader.jpg"/>

They are all voracious readers - sometimes they even have 
better test scores than native speakers. It's spooky how well 
avid reading correlates to fluent speaking.

While we focus on Chinese in this introduction, the benefits
of our approach to learning can apply to any language.

<h3>Meet the Enemy:</h3>




<div style='font-size: 1200%'>汉字</div>




These are the 'characters' that represent Chinese Characters.

<h3 id='problem'>The phonetic problem:</h3>

<h4>汉字 (Hàn zì) != Phonetic Sounds</h4>

Now, to be fair, billions of people use character systems.
In fact, if you ask a native speaker what their frustration
was when they first learned English, they will tell you the
complete opposite of the phonetic problem: Which is that
romanized words don't have pictures associated with them!

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/frustration.jpg"/>

But they are taking for granted that the romanization bootstraps
their language learning by giving them (nearly) immediate
access to the ability to pronounce what they see. =)

Ok, so, why is this a problem at all? Speakers of character-based
languages don't seem to think it's a problem, right? 
Well, it's a problem of frequency:

What would a foreigner in China, for example, do on a daily basis?

1. Reading philosophy texts?                          No.
2. Studying for your law degree?                      Ummmm. No.
3. Driving around the city reading street signs?      (Maybe). 
4. Having casual dinners with VIPs and business men?  Yeah, right.
5. Arguing with the wife about what's for dinner?     Yes! Yes!

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/teacher.jpg"/>

So, in my daily language learning classes, I told
the teacher, "I don't want to battle with the phonetic problem",
and immediately her reaction was, "What? You want to be illiterate?"

Well, of course not. Actually, I want to be VERY literate,
because as I foreshadowed above, the best foreign speakers
are the ones the read the most literature (and the ones that 
watch the most TV shows, too =).


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/bridgingthegap.jpg"/>

So, we need a tool - something to bridge the gap
between the ability to vocalize language and the ability to read
the vocalizations. Something that would immediately
give us the same mental stimulus for Character-based languages
that a well-spoken foreign English speaker would experience.

<h4>Enter: MICA.</h4>

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/smile.jpg"/>

<h3 id='usage'>Software Instructions:</h3>

Getting Started:

First, begin by copy and pasting a story using the 'Upload New Story'
button in the "Account" menu at the top:

You have two choices:

1. Upload a text file in native Characters (like a short story 
or even an e-book) in UTF-8 encoded format.
2. Copy and paste a news article or email in native characters.

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/upload.png"/>

As you can see in the above example, I have copy and pasted
the following characters, and selected "Chinese to English". If you
are learning English instead, you could similarly choose "English to Chinese".
We intend to add multiple languages soon:

<h2>花园里有三只蝴蝶，一只是红色的，一只是黄色的，一只是白色的。</h2>

Here is a similar example if you are learning English and, for example,
are a native Chinese speaker:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/engupload.png"/>

Since we assume the user is starting from scratch, MICA has never seen
these characters before and will create a new story in your database
containing your new story.

Click on the <b>Top Left</b> corner of the page to expand the navigation
section:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/uploaded.png"/>

There are 4 sections in the left-hand pane:

<ol>
<li><b>"Untranslated"</b>: These are stories that you just uploaded but
which have not yet been translated into Pinyin and English yet.</li>
<li><b>"Not reviewed"</b>: These are translated stories which have not
been reviewed first by a native Chinese speaker to correct for invalid
polyphomes, which we will explain later.</li>
<li><b>"Reading"</b>: These are post-reviewed stories which have passed up
through the lower two sections and ready for regular language learning
and review.</li>
<li><b>"Finished"</b>: Stories go here when you're finish learning from them.</li>
</ol>

You can begin by first clicking 'Translate' and waiting for your first translation.

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/translating.png"/>

Once the translation has completed, the story will appear in the "Not reviewed" section.
Some large stories, particularly ones that are very dense or have many pages,
can take a very long time to translate as MICA is doing a lot of work to properly group
together characters into words and prepare the story for you. Periodically
MICA has to go online to get a translation, or even reverse-engineer
Pinyin-to-character pronunciations, so be patient. (There's a lot going on behind the scenes).

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/translated.png"/>

After you refresh the page, the story will move into the 'Not Reviewed'
section like, this and will have a number of icons next to the story
to indicate the next steps you have to take in the story:

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/notreviewed.png"/>

First, you should click on the 'Magnifying Glass' icon to open
the story in 'Review' mode.

<h3 id='review'>Reviewing before Learning (Review Mode):</h3>

Now, we get to the good stuff first: Review mode is the first of the
three modes and designed to give the language learner and opportunity 
to read a "Sanitized" translated story.

This mode is used to build "clean" material for the learner to read. We
want to be able to process large amounts of meanings (and pinyin if this
is a character-based language) for the learner from MICA as fast as 
possible as if the learner were reading a book of literature with the 
same experience as an English novel. To do that, we first need to review
the text first for any errors in meaning or tone.

The problem in general is that not all words have a single meaning, and in
particular with Chinese, not all characters have the same tone,
and even words that have the same tone don't have the same meaning!

In "Review" mode, a new learner will want to get a "buddy" who is a native
speaker to "review" their newly uploaded story in this mode:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/viewmode.png"/>

Here is a similar example in Review mode of an English story from before:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/engreview.png"/>

The way review mode works is that non-blue words may or may not have more
than one definition, sound, or tone. In Chinese, these kinds of words are
also are called <b>"Polyphomes"</b>. These are words that have been identified 
as not having a single meaning and/or sound per word and are fuzzy or 
have the same sound but multiple definitions (for Chinese only).

As you can see from the "Legend" on the side, MICA classifies
and analyzes words in different ways:

<div style='font-weight: bold; color: grey; display: inline'>Grey words</div> only have a single sound and single meaning, and by
clicking on them you will see their translations of the word 
after the story was processed. For the reviewer, it is not necessary to
spend to much time on these words as they are NOT Polyphomes
and their translations already accurate. (If they are not correct, then
the database used by MICA can sometimes be wrong as well - it is not impossible).

<div style='font-weight: bold; color: green; display: inline'>Green words</div> only have a single sound but have different
meanings. For languages like Chinese, technically, they are not polyphomes, but they 
are treated as fuzzy, because they have different meanings. The language learner will
not inadvertently learn the wrong sound (safe), but may inadvertently learn
the wrong meaning. However, even if the wrong meaning is memorized without
a proper review by a native speaker, the incorrect meaning will immediately
become obvious in context as the meaning will likely not make much sense.

<div style='font-weight: bold; color: red; display: inline'>Red words</div> may several different sounds
as well sounds. These words need special attention by the reviewer 
so that the language learner does memorize the wrong meaning or tone. 
Eventually, more advanced learners can perform these reviews by oneself
because they will be able to select the correct choice by reading in context.

<div style='font-weight: bold; color: black; display: inline'>Black words</div> are words that have a "history" of being wrong
because they were previously reviewed and corrected in the past across
the entire story database. MICA performs sophisticated analytics to 
automatically recognize these words upon new translations and assigns 
percentages to figure out which polyphomes have the highest chance of 
being correct. The new story does not have any black words yet because 
we have not performed any corrections - to come later.

In the below example, we have clicked on the the words and pinyin 
for 'one': "yī" (一). This first results in exposing a small blue 'play
button. By clicking this button, the learner is challenged to first remember
what the meaning is before revealing it. This results in expanding all occurrences
of the character and its translation, resulting in showing the translation 
for that word.

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/definition1.png"/>

Red, green, and black words, however need to be reviewed for accuracy, 
by clicking on the word, the different possibilities for that character 
will appear. Let's first start with a "green" word:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple1.png"/>

If this were an english story, we could click on the word "Red",
revealing both a noun and an adjective:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/definition2.png"/>

In the above Chinese example, we have clicked on the sound 'lǐ' (里), which
usually means 'inside' of something. As you can see in the pop-up,
the 'Default' selected polyphome is incorrect - it translates to
500 meters (or half a kilometer. Half of a unit of measure is very
common in Chinese). Also noticed that because it's green, all the
sounds are exactly the same, but only differ in their English meaning.

Checking this is very important distinction in MICA, because later in
'Read' mode, MICA will keep track of exactly which words the learner
has memorized and which words the learner has not memorized. So,
if you don't correct the polyphomes, MICA will think you have memorized
the wrong word, when in fact you have not.

So, by choosing the 'Select' button, we can correct MICA so that
the correct word is 'inside':

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple.png"/>

Similarly, for English, the word "Red" is not a noun in this case,
but instead is an adjective. So by choosing the right meaning, we
have the result:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/engcorrect.png"/>

Also pay attention to the "Percentages" on the left-hand side
of the correct choice: This indicates that MICA
has recorded how 'popular' this selection is and will re-use this
information the next time a story is translated, so that the
reviewer does not need to select it again in the future.

Upon refreshing the page, this character is now listed as
'black', indicating that it now has a history in MICA:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple2.png"/>

Similary, for English, we would have:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple4.png"/>

It also includes a "(1)" next to it as well as being listed on
the right-hand side of the page indicating that this particular
word has undergone that number of changes in the history
of the database of stories for this user.

The next time a story that is translated containing this word,
MICA will modify the default choice to be the most popular one
so that the reviewer can focus their time on harder-to-identify
words.

Finally, let's take a look at "red" words, as in the word 'zhī' (只):

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple3.png"/>

This time, notice that MICA is telling us that there are multiple
completely different sounds for the same word. In this case,
there are both a 1st tone and 3rd tone listings for the same
character. This time, MICA chose the correct choice by
default, so there is no need to spend anymore time on this word. 

Unfortunately, if you haven't learned at least a little of your new
language before starting the software, you'll have to ask your best
friend, your significant other, or your co-worker who
is a native speaker to help you out on your first few stories 
until you get fluent enough at context-matching to know when a 
choice is wrong or not by yourself.

<h3 id='editing'>Edit Mode:</h3>

This mode is equally as import as 'Review' mode: Sometimes, MICA 
improperly groups the wrong words together, for example in a 
different story:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/badgroup.png"/>

This mode is not supported when learning a language like English,
because because words are single units of meaning. But in a Character-based
language, a single "word" can be composed of multiple picture-based
characters. This mode will be disabled if your story is originally
written in English.

In the above example, the characters (穿着) are incorrectly
grouped together by MICA, and since they are grouped together
they have a single, fixed meaning: 'Chuān zhuó', which translates
as "attire" a [beautiful flower dress]. This is not correct, and instead 
the characters should be separated, as in: (穿 着), which instead 
means: "Chuān zhe", which translates as "wear a" [beautiful flower dress].

Without a native speaker reviewing the story, the language learner
might clue in to the fact that 'attire' doesn't make much sense
in the story. They could confirm this fact by first clicking on
the characters themselves:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/badselected.png"/>

After clicking the characters, then you would click 'Instant' at 
the top of the page and wait for the online translation to complete:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/instantclick.png"/>

MICA will then do an instant translation online by translating
the individual characters in pieces and return an instant result:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/instant.png"/>

As you can see, the individual characters for (穿着) actually
translate roughly to: "wear a" [beautiful flower dress] as 
opposed to "attire" [beautiful flower dress].

Solution: To solve this problem, you would click on the "Split"
button at the top of the page selecting only the individual characters
for "attire" as their are currently listed.

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/splitselect.png"/>

A dialog will appear confirming that you indeed want to split this
word apart into its constituent characters:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/splitconfirm.png"/>

Which then results in reloading the story with the correct elements:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/splitfinish.png"/>

A similar problem happens in MICA when an already-separated group of
characters were not correctly merged into a single word, as in the
following example:

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergebad.png"/>

In the above examples, the two characters at the end of the sentence
"shí hòu" (时候) should in fact be merged into a single word
which instantly translates as "when" (an extension of the word 'time'):

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergeinstant.png"/>

This can easily be fixed in edit mode by, again selecting on the
individual words and then selecting the "Merge" icon buttom: 

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergetry.png"/>

After confirming that you really want to merge them together:

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergeconfirm.png"/>

The characters in the story will then read as:

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergecomplete.png"/>

(NOTE: A merge will not occur if MICA cannot find a definition
for a merged group of words - the result is that the characters will
continue to remain separated).

Finally, MICA is also smart enough to know the history of various
merged and split words. By clicking the 'forget' button on the left
hand side of the story and re-translating the story (or by translating
another story that shares some common characters with the above example),
we can see how MICA is learning our editing behavior as we use
the software:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/regroupsummary.png"/>

As you can see in the story and the legend, we now have the story
presented as it was originally translated without the proper edits,
but instead, MICA is showing us that the two previous words and
characters are "suggested" to be merged and split.

All of these tools together are designed to make the reading experience
as accurate as possible and as the language learner gets better and
better, they will need to rely less and less on others to correct
the story for them and more on themselves.

Notice there is a "Try Recommendations" in both Review Mode and Edit modes.
This option will "Bulk" edit or "Bulk" review any words recommended by MICA
that were found to need review or editing based on your previous usage history.

This is very useful in large books, like PDFs, where lots of content has
a similar, highly-repetitive review/edit history. MICAs analytics can automatically
recognized when these kinds of changes need to be repeated.

<h3 id='reading'>Reading Mode:</h3>

Here's where the real fun begins and the full benefit of
MICA comes in to play:

Once you (or your friend) have completed an initial review of
the story, you can go back to the side-panel and click the 'Up Arrow'
to "promote" the story to reading mode.

Once a story is promoted to reading mode,
it will appear in the "Reading" section:

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reviewed.png"/>

Click on the 'book' icon to begin reading the story.
You will now see a complete view of the reviewed story.

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reading1.png"/>

In English, the example might look like:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reading3.png"/>

In this mode, you will see a slightly different structure:
All the original words and corrected meanings are black,
but their translations are not automatically expanded by default.
This is to challenge the learner to try to remember words in
context before indicating to MICA which ones you have memorized.

By click the 'reveal' button icon at the top: 

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reveal.png"/>

We can automatically reveal all the meanings. (Or you can just click the individual
blue icons to reveal individual means, which is more common while
using the software over time.)

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reading.png"/>

And again, for English:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reading2.png"/>

What does this mean? If a word is automatically expanded upon
first loading the page, it means that you have not yet memorized
the word.

Let's start by interacting with MICA: Let's click on some of
the translations to indicate that we have memorized a couple of
the most commonly early-learned words:

We have clicked on the translations of the words "yī" (一), and 'zhī' (只):

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/memorizing.png"/>

In English, we can reveal and click on the word "Violet":

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/memorizing2.png"/>

MICA will process the request and then hide the translations
from you, indicating that you have memorized those words. In both cases,
MICA will memorize and record memorizations for all occurrences of those words. 

The resulting page will look like this with the memorized words hidden:

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/memorized.png"/>

And again In English: 

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/memorized2.png"/>

These words will stay hidden by default the next time you come
back to read this story in the future.

Furthermore, if you reload the whole webpage after reading for a while, 
you will notice that the right-hand side of the page has more
useful tracking information:

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/engprogress.png"/>

This is kind of self-explanatory, but gives you some rewarding information
about exactly what percentage of the words you have memorized.

And, let's say that a week later you have forgotten a particular word, you can
simply find the word in the list, click the 'X' and the MICA
will record that the word has been forgotten (or un-memorized).

Even if you forget the word, but don't want to remove it from the
memorization list, you can just click on the 'black' pinyin readings
of the words to expose the original translation without
telling MICA to track anything additionally.

Furthermore: Just as in the 'Review' and 'Edit' modes, newly translated
stories will automatically track which words you have memorized and
which ones you have not memorized without you having to re-select
them in the future. As the database grows with more stories, the
software helps you out.

This where the real power comes from: 
You can now spend much finer granularities of time using the 
'Reading' mode of the software as well as having conversations 
with native speakers to help you navigate the stories you 
are reading while you read more and more complicated texts. 
The more you read, the more you are forced to speak in your mind, 
and the better you become!

<h3>Happy reading!</h3>
