MICA is a language-learning memory-assisted software program
for Chinese that tracks what words you know and don't know
as you read through stories.

<h3 id='motivation'>Motivation:</h3>
The basic observation behind creating this learning
system is very simple: The most well-spoken foreigners
in the USA all have one thing in common: 

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reader.jpg"/>

They are all voracious readers - sometimes they even have 
better SAT scores than native speakers. It's spooky how well 
avid reading correlates to fluent speaking.

But it's not fair, why?

<h3>Meet the Enemy:</h3>




<div style='font-size: 1200%'>汉字</div>




These are the characters than represent Chinese Characters.

<h3 id='problem'>The phonetic problem:</h3>

<h4>汉字 (Hàn zì) != Phonetic Sounds</h4>

Now, to be fair, billions of people use character systems.
In fact, if you ask a native speaker what their frustration
was when they first learned English, they will tell you the
complete opposite of the phonetic problem: Which is that
romanized words don't have pictures associated with them!

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/frustration.jpg"/>

But they are taking for granted that the romanization bootstraps
their language learning by giving them (nearly) immediate
access to the ability to pronounce what they see. =)

Ok, so, why is this a problem at all? Chinese people don't
seem to think it's a problem, right? Well, it's a problem of
frequency:

What does a foreigner in China do on a daily basis?

1. Reading Chinese philosophy texts?                  No.
2. Studying for your Chinese law degree?              Ummmm. No.
3. Driving around the city reading street signs?      Hell no.
4. Having casual dinners with VIPs and business men?  Yeah, right.
5. Arguing with the wife about what's for dinner?     Yes! Yes!

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/teacher.jpg"/>

So, in my daily language learning class here in China, I told
the teacher, "I don't want to battle with the phonetic problem",
and immediately her reaction was, "What? You want to be illiterate?"

Well, of course not. Actually, I want to be VERY literate,
because as I foreshadowed above, the best foreign speakers
are the ones the read the most literature (and the ones that 
watch the most TV shows, too =).


<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/bridgingthegap.jpg"/>

So, I need a bridge - an olive branch. Something to bridge the gap
between the ability to vocalize language and the ability to read
the vocalizations. Something that bridges the gap would immediately
give me the same mental stimulus for Chinese that a well-spoken
foreign English speaker would experience in the USA.

<h4>Enter: MICA.</hr>

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/smile.jpg"/>

<h3 id='usage'>Software Instructions:</h3>

Getting Started:

First, begin by copy and pasting a story using the 'Upload New Story'
button:

You have two choices:

1. Upload a text file in native Chinese Characters (like a short story 
or even an e-book) in UTF-8 encoded format.
2. Copy and paste a news article or email in Native Chinese characters.

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/upload.png"/>

As you can see in the above example, I have copy and pasted
the following characters:

<h2>花园里有三只蝴蝶，一只是红色的，一只是黄色的，一只是白色的。</h2>

Since we assume the user is starting from scratch, MICA has never seen
these characters before and will create a new story in your database
containing your new story.

Click on the <b>Top Left</b> corner of the page to expand the navigation
section:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/uploaded.png"/>

There are 3 sections in the left-hand pane:

<ol>
<li><b>"Untranslated"</b>: These are stories that you just uploaded but
which have not yet been translated into Pinyin and English yet.</li>
<li><b>"Not reviewed"</b>: These are translated stories which have not
been reviewed first by a native Chinese speaker to correct for invalid
polyphomes, which we will explain later.</li>
<li><b>"Reading"</b>: These are post-reviewed stories which have passed up
through the lower two sections and ready for regular language learning
and review.</li>
</ol>

You can begin by first clicking 'Translate' and waiting for your first
translation. (Multiple stories can be translated in parallel).

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/translating.png"/>

Once the translation has completed, you'll see a message instructing
you to refresh the page. Some large stories can take a very long
time to translate as MICA is doing a lot of work to properly group
together characters into words and prepare the story for you. Periodically
MICA has to go online to get a translation, or even reverse-engineer
Pinyin-to-character pronunciations, so be patient.

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/translated.png"/>

After you refresh the page, the story will move into the 'Not Reviewed'
section like, this and will have a number of icons next to the story
to indicate the next steps you have to take in the story:

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/notreviewed.png"/>

First, you should click on the 'Magnifying Glass' icon to open
the story in 'View' mode.

<h3 id='review'>Reviewing before Learning (View Mode):</h3>

Now, we get to the good stuff first: View mode is the first of the
three modes and designed to give the language learner and opportunity 
to read a "Sanitized" translated story.

This means that we need "clean" Pinyin for the learner to read. We
want to be able to process large amounts of pinyin to the learner
from MICA as fast as possible as if the learner were reading a book
of literature with the same experience as an English novel.

The problem is that not all Chinese characters have the same tone,
and even words that have the same tone don't have the same meaning!

In "View" mode, a new learner will want to get a native-Chinese speaking
friend to "review" their newly uploaded story in this mode:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/viewmode.png"/>

The way review mode works is that non-blue words are called <b>"Polyphomes"</b>.
These are words that have been identified as not having a single 
sound per character and are fuzzy or have the same sound but multiple
English definitions.

As you can see from the "Legend" on the side, MICA classifies
character groups into words and then analyzes each word in
different ways:

<div style='font-weight: bold; color: blue; display: inline'>Blue words</div> only have a single sound and single meaning, and by
clicking on them you will see the English translation of the word 
after the story was processed. For the reviewer, it is not necessary to
spend to much time correcting these words as they are NOT Polyphomes
and their translations (both pinyin and English) already accurate.

<div style='font-weight: bold; color: green; display: inline'>Green words</div> only have a single sound but have different English
meanings. Technically, they are not polyphomes, but they are treated
as fuzzy, because they have different meanings. The language learner will
not inadvertently learn the wrong sound (safe), but may inadvertently learn
the wrong meaning. However, even if the wrong meaning is memorized without
a proper review by a native speaker, the incorrect meaning will immediately
become obvious in context as the meaning will likely not make much sense.

<div style='font-weight: bold; color: red; display: inline'>Red words</div> are polyphomes that have both several different sounds
as well as English translations. These words need special attention by 
the reviewer so that the language learner does memorize the wrong tone. 
Eventually, more advanced learners can perform these reviews by oneself
because they will be able to select the correct English translation paired
with the correct tone by reading in context.

<div style='font-weight: bold; color: black; display: inline'>Black words</div> are polyphomes that have a "history" of being wrong
because they were previously reviewed and corrected in the past across
the entire story database. MICA automatically recognizes these words upon 
new translations and assigns percentages to figure out which polyphomes
have the highest chance of being correct. The new story does not have
any black words yet because we have not performed any corrections - 
to come later.

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/definition.png"/>

In the above example, we have clicked on the the words and pinyin 
for 'one': "yī" (一). This results in expanding all occurrences
of the character and its translation, resulting in showing the English
for that character grouping.

Red, green, and black words, however need to be reviewed for accuracy, 
by clicking on the word, the different possibilities for that character 
will appear. Let's first start with a "green" word:

<img width='40%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple1.png"/>

In the above example, we have clicked on the sound 'lǐ' (里), which
usually means 'inside' of something. As you can see in the pop-up,
the 'Default' selected polyphome is incorrect - it translates to
500 meters (or half a kilometer. Half of a unit of measure is very
common in Chinese). Also noticed that because it's green, all the
sounds are exactly the same, but only differ in their English meaning.

Checking this is very important distinction in MICA, because later in
'Read' mode, MICA will keep track of exactly which words the learner
has memorized and which words the learner has not memorized. So,
if you don't correct the polyphomes, MICA will think you have memorized
the wrong word, when in fact you have not.

So, by choosing the 'Select' button, we can correct MICA so that
the correct word is 'inside':

<img width='40%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple.png"/>

Also pay attention to the "Percentages" on the left-hand side
of the correctly chosen polyphome: This indicates that MICA
has recorded how 'popular' this selection is and will re-use this
information the next time a story is translated. 

Upon refreshing the page, this character is now listed as a
'black' polyphome, indicating that it now has a history in
MICA:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple2.png"/>

It also includes a "(1)" next to it as well as being listed on
the right-hand side of the page indicating that this particular
character has undergone that number of changes in the history
of the database of stories for this user.

The next time a story that is translated containing this character,
MICA will modify the default polyphome to be the most popular one
so that the reviewer can focus their time on harder-to-identify
polyphomes.

Finally, let's take a look at "red" words, as in the word 'zhī' (只):

<img width='40%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/polysimple3.png"/>

This time, notice that MICA is telling us that there are multiple
completely different sounds for the same word. In this case,
there are both a 1st tone and 3rd tone listings for the same
character. This time, MICA chose the correct polyphome by
default, so there is no need to spend anymore time on this word. 

Unfortunately, if you haven't learned at least a little Chinese
before starting the software, you'll have to ask your best
friend, your significant other, or your co-worker who does 
read/write Chinese to help you out on your first few stories 
until you get fluent enough at context-matching to know when a 
tone is the wrong tone or not by yourself.

<h3 id='editing'>Edit Mode:</h3>

This mode is equally as import as 'Review' mode: Sometimes, MICA 
improperly groups the wrong words together, for example in a 
different story: 

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/badgroup.png"/>

In the above example, the characters (穿着) are incorrectly
grouped together by MICA, and since they are grouped together
they have a single, fixed meaning: 'Chuān zhuó', which translates
as "attire" a [beautiful flower dress]. This not correct, and instead 
the characters should be separated, as in: (穿 着), which instead 
means: "Chuān zhe", which translates as "wear a" [beautiful flower dress].

Without a native speaker reviewing the story, the language learner
might clue in to the fact that 'attire' doesn't make much sense
in the story. They could confirm this fact by first clicking on
the characters themselves: 

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/badselected.png"/>

After clicking the characters, then you would click 'Instant' at 
the top of the page and wait for the online translation to complete:

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/instantclick.png"/>

MICA will then do an instant translation online by translating
the individual characters in pieces and return an instant result:

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/instant.png"/>

As you can see, the individual characters for (穿着) actually
translate roughly to: "wear a" [beautiful flower dress] as 
opposed to "attire" [beautiful flower dress].

Solution: To solve this problem, you would click on the "Edit"
button at the top of the page and again select the individual characters
for "attire" as their are currently listed.

Then at the top of the page, select "Re-group" =&gt; "Split Word Apart":

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/splitselect.png"/>

A dialog will appear confirming that you indeed want to split this
word apart into its constituent characters:

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/splitconfirm.png"/>

Which then results in reloading the story with the correct elements:

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/splitfinish.png"/>

A similar problem happens in MICA when an already-separated group of
characters were not correctly merged into a single word, as in the
following example:

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergebad.png"/>

In the above examples, the two characters at the end of the sentence
"shí hòu" (时候) should in fact be merged into a single word
which instantly translates as "when" (an extension of the word 'time'):

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergeinstant.png"/>

This can easily be fixed in edit mode by, again selecting on the
individual characters and then selecting: "Re-Group" =&gt; "Merge Characters":

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergetry.png"/>

After confirming that you really want to merge them together:

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergeconfirm.png"/>

The characters in the story will then read as:

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/mergecomplete.png"/>

(NOTE: A merge will not occur if MICA cannot find an English definition
for a merged group of characters - the result is that the characters will
continue to remain separated).

Finally, MICA is also smart enough to know the history of various
merged and split words. By clicking the 'forget' button on the left
hand side of the story and re-translating the story (or by translating
another story that shares some common characters with the above example),
we can see how MICA is learning our editing behavior as we use
the software:

<img width='70%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/regroupsummary.png"/>

As you can see in the story and the legend, we now have the story
presented as it was originally translated without the proper edits,
but instead, MICA is showing us that the two previous words and
characters are "suggested" to be merged and split.

All of these tools together are designed to make the reading experience
as accurate as possible and as the language learner gets better and
better, they will need to rely less and less on others to correct
the story for them and more on themselves.

<h3 id='reading'>Reading Mode:</h3>

Here's where the real fun begins and the full benefit of
MICA comes in to play:

Once you (or your friend) have completed an initial review of
the story, you can go back to the side-panel and click the 'Up Arrow'
on to "promote" the story to reading mode.

Once a story is promoted to reading mode,
it will appear in the "Reading" section:

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reviewed.png"/>

Click on the 'book' icon to begin reading the story.
You will now see a complete view of the reviewed story.

<img width='90%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/reading.png"/>

In this mode, you will see a slightly different structure:
All the original Chinese words and corrected pinyin are black,
but their English translations are automatically expanded by
default.

What does this mean? If a word is automatically expanded upon
first loading the page, it means that you have not yet memorized
the word.

Let's start by interacting with MICA: Let's click on some of
the translations to indicate that we have memorized a couple of
the most commonly early-learned words in Chinese: 

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/memorizing.png"/>

We have clicked on the English translations of the words "yī" (一),
and 'zhī' (只):

MICA will process the request and then hide the English translations
from you, indicating that you have memorized those words. In both cases,
MICA will memorize and record memorizations for all 
occurrences of those character groupings.

The resulting page will look like this with the memorized words
hidden:

<img width='50%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/memorized.png"/>

These words will stay hidden by default the next time you come
back to read this story in the future.

Furthermore, if you reload the whole webpage after reading for a while, 
you will notice that the right-hand side of the page has more
useful tracking information:

<img width='30%' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinesmr/mica/master/serve/images/engprogress.png"/>

This is kind of self-explanatory, but gives you some rewarding information
about exactly what percentage of the words you have memorized.

And, let's say that a week later you have forgotten a particular word, you can
simply find the word in the list, click the 'X' and the MICA
will record that the word has been forgotten (or un-memorized).

Even if you forget the word, but don't want to remove it from the
memorization list, you can just click on the 'black' pinyin readings
of the words to expose the original English translation without
telling MICA to track anything additionally.

Furthermore: Just as in the 'Review' and 'Edit' modes, newly translated
stories will automatically track which words you have memorized and
which ones you have not memorized without you having to re-select
them in the future. As the database grows with more stories, the
software helps you out.

This where the real power comes from: 
You can now spend much finer granularities of time using the 
'Reading' mode of the software as well as having conversations 
with native Chinese speakers to help you navigate the stories you 
are reading while you read more and more complicated texts. 
The more you read, the more you are forced to speak in your mind, 
and the better you become!

<h3>Happy reading!</h3>
