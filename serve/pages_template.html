"<b>MICA</b> is a <b>new way</b> to learn a language, like Chinese.",

"Why can't we use the <b>existing content</b> that's already out there?",
"Like <b>books</b>, blogs, new articles, and eventually <b>social media</b>.",
"MICA works by <b>analytics</b>: You read <b>existing</b> books or stories and it <b>tracks your brain</b>.",
"When you've learned a word, it <b>remembers</b>. When you read a new story, it <b>hides the words</b> you already know.",
