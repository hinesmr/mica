<h3><b>MICA Privacy Policy:</b></h3>

MICA is open source software. You are welcome to join the project or inspect its quality.

<a href="http://github.com/hinesmr/mica">http://github.com/hinesmr/mica</a>

MICA does not (currently) connect to any social networking or sharing capabilities with
other websites other than distributing your stories and learning progress among the devices
you are using with your account.

MICA's security depends eclusively on the security of CouchDB for both user authentication and
data management. If vulnerabilities are discovered in CouchDB, we promise to do whatever it 
takes to apply the necessary recovery procedures.

As of now, MICA does not ask for any personal information whatsoever outside of the basic
creation of an account and password on the server. We would like to expand into a more
social experience in the future, but simply don't have the manpower right now to work on it.

If you have any questions at all about your privacy here that is not clear, please contact us.
